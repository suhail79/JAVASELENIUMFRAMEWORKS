    /*
    In Java, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program and
     disrupts the normal flow of the program. Exceptions are used to handle errors and
     unexpected situations that may arise during the execution of a Java program.
     When an exception occurs, it is said to be "thrown," and the program's execution can be interrupted
     and transferred to a special code block called an exception handler.
